## What is WARD?

Web Application Rapid Development (WARD) is a methodology that focuses on efficiency and speed and allow developers to build rapid prototypes and functional versions of web applications. This approach aims to accelerate the development cycle, from the conception of the idea to the implementation and deployment of the web application. Is supported by tools and technologies that facilitate the build and continuous iteration of your project.

The fundamental principles of WARD include:

1. **Rapid Prototyping:** The rapid creation of prototypes is encouraged to visualize and validate concepts before committing to full development.
2. **Continuous Iteration:** WARD promotes short development cycles that allow quick adjustments based on changing feedback and requirements.
3. **Integrated Tools:** WARD relies on integrated tools, frameworks, and libraries that facilitate the efficient construction of web applications.
4. **Modular Approach:** The creation of reusable components and modules is encouraged to accelerate development and maintain a clean and easily maintainable codebase.
5. **Automation:** WARD embraces automation practices for repetitive tasks, testing, and deployment, enhancing efficiency and the quality of the development process.
